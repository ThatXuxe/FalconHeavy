## About
FalconBot is built around parsing the internet within discord. With commands such as google, youtube and wiki, FalconBot helps you find information you need instantaneously.

FalconBot also has some fun features such as emotify, cat and trivia commands and more.

The Bot has some moderation features like Ban and Kick, with more coming soon.

FalconBot also has music features which are currently in Beta.

With features like math and lyrics, you can do a lot of extra tasks and get a lot of information without ever having to leave discord.

## Getting Started

You can invite the bot to a discord server where you have the Permission: MANAGE_SERVER.
Follow [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=511949995776147466&scope=bot&permissions=36826176) OAuth Link.

### Installing

The bot is ready to go once it joins your server.
However, this bot has a minimal amount of permissions, meaning !!ban and !!kick will not work by default. However, you can easily modify this by adding those permissions to its roles.

```
!!ban <@Mention>
!!kick <@Mention>
!!purge <number>
```


## Using the bot

For commands, `//` is the prefix.
Use //help to see a comprehensive list of commands.
